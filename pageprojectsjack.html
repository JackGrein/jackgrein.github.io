    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created, took, and presented to a board to recieve funding to this project because I wanted to try another project that merged both my mechanical and programming knowledge, and to expand upon it to create this intruging robotic spider. I wanted the challenge of being able to build something that was not only able to walk around, but also able to be moldable in its function through programmable limbs and joints, and eventually be able to sense things in the world around it. This is an ongoing project, and though I did complete the objective I sought out to do, I wanted to do more with the project. Most of the ideas I had orientated around adding more actions to the limbs, like making it dance, jump, or have a higher or lower stance. However, I did have ideas to add a whole muilti-axled robot arm on top of the spider bot. However, I would need to go in front of the board again and present it as a whole new project. I am planning to do that in the future, when they have their board open for personal projects, which will end up being later in the semester.</span>

    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some problems I had encountered with this project was first definitely where to begin. Once I had that figured out and came up with a timeline and objectives to complete, It was all about either soldering together a board or finding one that will take and handle all the connections to and from the servo motors. I started out trying to solder something together, but then another student pulled out a servo board that was exactly what I needed. The next problem I had was trying to integrate that old board to follow and carry out commands from the arduino software. That process took a couple weeks, but I was able to find bits and pieces of some old documentation online from their github that I could use for giving specific instructions to each servo. After that, The most challenging part was getting the communication between the esp32 circuit board and the old circuit board to talk to each other. I decided to go with serial communication, through each boards RX/TX ports. That would have been even more difficult if I hadn't been able to find the old circuit board's schematics online, after downloading Eagle, a board schematic viewing software. My second to last problems I came to was then the communication between the esp32 and my phone, but after trial and error with the some bluetooth communication, I was able to give the esp32 commands, which gave the other circuit board different commands based off of what input I gave it. The last problem I had was getting the robotic spider, once built, not to stand up, but walk on it's own. This was due to the heavy parts that I placed into the spider, along with the weak servo motors, as when it was walking, part of the walking sequence was that one leg would carry it's entire side's weight, which most of the time it had a hard time doing, because the servo wasn't rated to carry that much load, and thus tended to give out. I had struggled with that prolem for a while, between trying to cut the weight down, to securing the joints to each other better, making it more rigid.</span>

    <br>
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back, If I was able to do this project over again, I would have spent more budget getting the more torque capable servos for the middle joints, the part of the leg that lifts the most, and carries the most load. I came into this project thinking that I was going to easily be able to have the spider bot lift itself off the ground, and it does, but I didn't take into account that most of the walking program I made for it would be consistently have only one leg on the ground at a time.</span>
