    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Jack Greiner. I am studying Mechatronics Engineering at RIT. I am a 3rd year student, with a heavy interest in robotics, automation, and the merging of the real life mechanics of the world with computer aided technology.</p>

    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been interested in engineering because I always wanted to take stuff apart and put it back together to see how it worked, and ways to kind of automate certain processes and thus make the task easier, increasing efficiency. I also wanted to have a potential impact on the world with the things I made. What really got me interested in robotics was when I took a class called Electronics & Engineering in high school and had such a fascination with the projects we did, like a line-following robot that we had to program. From the movements of the motors to the actions the sensors did when they detected a certain change in color. I was able to pick it up pretty quickly because I was also taking a programming class at that time, and I think it made me realize how much of a unity there was between the mechanical, electrical, and computer side of a device, and how much they rely on each other in order to work properly, or at all. That was the kind of thing I was looking for when I started college when started out as undecided because I didnâ€™t want to have to do just stuff with machines or just stuff with computers because I felt like I would be missing out on the other. When Mechatronics Engineering came up during the seminar class, I had decided what I wanted to do, and I am glad that I made that decision.</span>
