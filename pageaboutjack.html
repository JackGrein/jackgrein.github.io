            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Jack Greiner. I am studying Mechatronics Engineering at RIT. I am a 4th year student, 
                with a heavy interest in robotics, automation, and the merging of the real life mechanics of the world with computer aided technology.</p>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column-left">
                        <img style="margin:0px 20px 0px 20px;" id="picAbot1" src="/imagefiles/PXL_20220310_224752482.MP.jpg" height="400" alt="This is a picture of the water" title="A Great View!"></div>
                    <div class="column-right">
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been interested in engineering because I always wanted 
                            to take stuff apart and put it back together to see how it worked, and ways to kind of automate certain processes 
                            and thus make the task easier, increasing efficiency. I also wanted to have a potential impact on the world with 
                            the things I made.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really got me interested in robotics was when I took a class called Electronics & Engineering 
                            in high school and had such a fascination with the projects we did, like a line-following robot that we had to program. From the 
                            movements of the motors to the actions the sensors did when they detected a certain change in color. I was able to pick it up pretty 
                            quickly because I was also taking a programming class at that time, and I think it made me realize how much of a unity there was between 
                            the mechanical, electrical, and computer side of a device, and how much they rely on each other in order to work properly, or at all.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the kind of thing I was looking for when I started college when started out as undecided because I didnâ€™t want to have to do just 
                            stuff with machines or just stuff with computers because I felt like I would be missing out on the other. When Mechatronics Engineering came 
                            up during the seminar class, I had decided what I wanted to do, and I am glad that I made that decision!</p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently focusing on my Co-op with General Motors up in MI, but when I am not at work, I like to improve my programming skills, and 
                            countinue to develop the version 2 spiderbot. I also try to keep in touch with my friends and family back home, and make effort 
                            to make new ones here in Michigan.
                        </p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After my Co-op is over, I will look forward to finishing up my last 2 semesters of school at RIT in Rochester NY, and countinue to 
                            work on the combat robotics in my school's robotics club, and start work on other projects as well, after completing my currently running project!
